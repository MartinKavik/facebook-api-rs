# Facebook API for Rust and Wasm

- This crate is intended for front_end and supposed to be used with the custom `https client` of your choice as long as it uses [http-types](https://docs.rs/http-types/2.11.0/http_types/).

- The Facebook API requires an `access token`.

- The implementation of the Facebook API is done via the help of the following [Facebook for Developers documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/manually-build-a-login-flow)
